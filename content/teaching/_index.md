During my PhD study, I have been enjoying teaching and organizing teaching activities,
such as exercises and examinations. 
It helps me gain valuable experience in management and commnication.

Here are the list of courses I have taught so far.

- **Data Management Systems**: Head TA & Invited Speaker (Fall 2024), TA (Fall 2025)
- **Hardware Acceleration for Data Processing Seminar**: Invited Speaker (Fall 2024)
- **Data Modeling and Databases**: TA (Spring 2024, 2025)
- **Information Systems for Engineers**: TA (Fall 2023)

I am also very fortunate to work with talented students on various projects.

**Master's Thesis**

- [**Sepehr Pourghannad**](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/sepehr-pourghannad): Integrated Eiger, a high-performance GPU-based query engine, into [Maximus](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/PUB-SYSTEMS/eth-dataprocessing/Maximus), a modular database working with heterogeneous hardware.  
- [**Dominic Steiner**](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/dominic-steiner-ch) (now as a software engineer at Optiver). Profiled the NCCL library for the distributed database workloads and proposed optimizations that greatly improve the distributed operator's performance in Eiger.

**Semester Projects**

- [**Cong Vu**](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/ba-cong-vu-a38480212): Studying unified memory and memory spilling for out-of-memory data processing on the GPU platform.
- [**Diana Micloiu**](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/diana-micloiu-16b049248): Porting Eiger from CUDA to ROCm, profiling performance differences, and performing optimizations.
- [**Marios Angelis**](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/marios-g-angelis-233a46143) (Incoming intern at IBM research center): Implemented high-performance GPU-based database operators, such as left-join, semi-join, and anti-join, in Eiger.
